# Relationship Deception and Manipulation Patterns

Use this as a reference to spot patterns over time. One instance can be a mistake. Repeated patterns are a signal.

1. Future faking

   Description: Big promises about a shared future that never convert into plans or action.
   Examples:
   - Talks about moving in together but never looks at dates or budgets
   - Announces a trip next spring without checking calendars or savings
   - Mentions engagement timing often yet avoids any concrete steps

2. Love bombing then withdrawal

   Description: Intense attention and affection early, followed by a sudden pullback once attachment forms.
   Examples:
   - Rapid I love you messages in week two, then slow replies for days
   - Daily gifts and long calls in month one, then claims to be too busy indefinitely
   - Pushes for exclusivity quickly, then becomes emotionally distant

3. Gaslighting

   Description: Twisting facts to make you doubt your memory, perception, or sanity.
   Examples:
   - Denies saying something that you have in writing
   - Calls you crazy or too sensitive when you raise a valid concern
   - Moves goalposts and claims you are forgetting the real agreement

4. DARVO

   Description: Deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender when confronted about behavior.
   Examples:
   - After being caught lying, insists you are the liar
   - Responds to calm questions with character attacks

8. Paperclipping or zombieing

## How to use this list

Track patterns over time. A single mistake can be repaired. Repeated behaviors signal misalignment.

Pair with a trust plan. Confirm words with actions, use clear boundaries, and escalate commitment only after reliability is shown.

Document facts. Save dates, plans, and agreements in writing so memory games do not take over.

There is also a [fillable spreadsheet you can use](/Workfiles/Relationship_Deception_Tracker.xlsx) to calculate someone's score.
