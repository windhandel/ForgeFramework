# Forge Framework

Forge Framework is an evolving collection of ideas, practices, and tools designed to help individuals and teams align identity, execution, and outcomes.  
It draws inspiration from thought leaders like Brian Tracy, Zig Ziglar, and other high-performance frameworks, while staying practical for everyday use.

## Purpose

The goal of Forge Framework is to provide:

- **Clarity of Identity (Be):** Defining who you are becoming and the values you live by.  
- **Disciplined Execution (Do):** Establishing habits, systems, and focus that drive meaningful progress.  
- **Aligned Outcomes (Have):** Measuring results, celebrating wins, and refining the approach for continual growth.

## Evaluation and Analysis

To create meaningful transformation, it is essential to identify the **gaps** between where you are and where you want to be. The Forge Framework uses multiple lenses of analysis:

1. [**Mindset / Belief Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Mindset.md)
   - Surfaces limiting beliefs, doubts, or identity conflicts.  
   - Reframes them into empowering mental models aligned with purpose.  

2. [**Archetypal Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Archetypal.md)
   - Examines which archetypes (e.g., Hero, Sage, Creator, Caregiver, etc.) you are currently embodying versus those required to fulfill your vision.  
   - Highlights underdeveloped roles that could balance or expand your growth.  

3. [**Functional / Life Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Functional.md)
   - Evaluates areas of life such as health, wealth, relationships, career, learning, and contribution.  
   - Surfaces deficits that can prevent long-term stability or fulfillment.  

4. [**Skill Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Skill.md)
   - Identifies specific abilities or knowledge missing that would accelerate progress.  
   - Useful for career, entrepreneurship, or creative pursuits.  

5. [**Behavioral Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Behavioral.md)
   - Maps current habits, routines, and actions against the habits required to achieve goals.  
   - Clarifies what to start, stop, or optimize.  

6. [**Resource Gap Analysis**](/GapAnalysis/Resource.md)
   - Looks at external supports: time, money, energy, networks, tools.  
   - Reveals what resources need to be acquired, conserved, or reallocated.  

By combining these types, the Forge Framework provides **identity assessment**, **inner alignment** and **outer strategy** for growth.

## Be, Do, Have

A central principle of the Forge Framework is **[BeDoHave.md](BeDoHave.md)** which, successfully executed, inverts your thinking    from Do, Have Be to Be, Do, Have. Or, in other words, :

- **Be:** Focus on identity, mindset, and values. Who you choose to become shapes everything else.  
- **Do:** Take consistent, disciplined action aligned with your identity. Habits and systems drive results.  
- **Have:** Achieve outcomes that reflect both effort and alignment, then refine the cycle for continued growth.  

For a deeper dive into this principle and how it applies within Forge Framework, see the [BeDoHave.md](BeDoHave.md) document.

## Vision

Forge begins with vision. Without a clear picture of the future, execution has no compass. Vision involves:  

- **Defining your ideal state** across personal and professional domains.  
- **Using imagination and creativity** to project possibilities beyond current limits.  
- **Anchoring the vision** in values, purpose, and archetypes that resonate deeply.  

---

## Goal Setting

Goal setting transforms vision into actionable targets:  

- Apply **clarity of intent** (Brian Tracy’s principle: “Success starts with clarity”).  
- Write **specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound (SMART)** goals.  
- Prioritize using methods like **ABCDE analysis** or **Pareto’s 80/20 rule**.  
- Create a **hierarchy of goals**: lifetime, 5-year, 1-year, quarterly, and weekly.  

---

## Self-Actualization

Self-actualization is the pursuit of becoming your fullest self, not just achieving outcomes. Within the Forge Framework, it includes:  

- **Identity Development:** Growing into the person who can hold greater responsibility and fulfillment.  
- **Integration:** Balancing archetypes and life areas into a cohesive whole.  
- **Transcendence:** Moving beyond survival or success into contribution, creativity, and legacy.  

---

## Execution

Execution turns plans into results. Forge emphasizes disciplined yet adaptive action:  

- **Focus:** Concentrate on the single most impactful task daily (“Eat That Frog”).  
- **Systems & Habits:** Build routines that reduce friction and automate progress.  
- **Measurement:** Track key metrics and adjust regularly.  
- **Accountability:** Use partners, mentors, or communities to sustain momentum.  
- **Iteration:** Review, refine, and realign through feedback and reflection loops.
