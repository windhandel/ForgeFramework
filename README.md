# Forge Framework

Forge Framework is an evolving collection of ideas, practices, and tools designed to help individuals and teams align identity, execution, and outcomes.  
It draws inspiration from thought leaders like Brian Tracy, Zig Ziglar, and other high-performance frameworks, while staying practical for everyday use.

## Purpose

The goal of Forge Framework is to provide:

- **Clarity of Identity (Be):** Defining who you are becoming and the values you live by.  
- **Disciplined Execution (Do):** Establishing habits, systems, and focus that drive meaningful progress.  
- **Aligned Outcomes (Have):** Measuring results, celebrating wins, and refining the approach for continual growth.

## Be, Do, Have

A central principle of the Forge Framework is the **Be, Do, Have** model:  

- **Be:** Focus on identity, mindset, and values. Who you choose to become shapes everything else.  
- **Do:** Take consistent, disciplined action aligned with your identity. Habits and systems drive results.  
- **Have:** Achieve outcomes that reflect both effort and alignment, then refine the cycle for continued growth.  

For a deeper dive into this principle and how it applies within Forge Framework, see the [BeDoHave.md](BeDoHave.md) document.
